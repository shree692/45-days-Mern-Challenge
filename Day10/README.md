Day 10 | CRUD Operations Challenge (Create & Read)
I implemented Create (POST) and Read (GET) operations for my Projects API using Express.js + MongoDB.

- Added express.json() middleware for JSON parsing

- Created POST /api/projects endpoint → insert new projects into MongoDB

- Created GET /api/projects endpoint → fetch all projects

- Added basic validation (title & description required)

- Implemented createdAt & updatedAt timestamps

- Tested endpoints using Postman
